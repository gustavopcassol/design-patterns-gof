Code in "structure" packages are created based on the "Structure" and "Participants" parts of the book.

Liberties taken on "structure" packages:

- Classes with undefined visibility are "package-private";
- Fields with undefined visibility are "private";
- Fields with undefined type are "int";
- Methods with undefined visibility are "package-private";
- Methods with undefined type are "void";
- Getters and setters are implemented; and
- Other small changes based on linters recommendations.
